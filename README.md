# Face Detection and Gender-Age Prediction using OpenCV

This repository contains two Python projects for face detection: one using the lightweight Haar Cascade model and another leveraging the power of OpenCV's pre-trained deep learning model, which additionally provides gender and age detection.

## Features

- **Haar Cascade Model**:
  - Lightweight and easy to implement.
  - Real-time face detection with minimal computational resources.
  - Ideal for simple applications and devices with limited processing power.

- **OpenCV Pre-trained Model**:
  - Advanced face detection with higher accuracy.
  - Predicts gender and age from detected faces.
  - Suitable for more complex applications requiring robust detection and additional insights.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Numpy

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```
